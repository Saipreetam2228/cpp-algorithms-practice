# Algorithms

This folder contains C++ implementations of common algorithms, organized by topic for easy navigation and practice.

The purpose of this folder is to provide hands-on examples for learning algorithmic concepts, improving problem-solving skills, and building a strong foundation in programming.

## 📌 Contents
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.
- **Recursion**: Factorial, Fibonacci, and other recursive problems
- **Extra / Experimental**: Additional practice codes and experimental solutions

## 🛠 Language
- C++

## 🎯 Purpose
- Practice algorithmic problem-solving in C++
- Understand the implementation of key algorithms
- Support learning from reference materials in the `materials` folder

## 🚀 Usage
Clone the repository and navigate topic-wise to explore the code:

```bash
